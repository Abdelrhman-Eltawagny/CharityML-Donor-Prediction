# CharityML-Donor-Prediction
CharityML is a fictitious non-profit organization based in Silicon Valley, focused on supporting individuals eager to learn machine learning. The organization observed that all its donations came from individuals earning more than $50,000 annually.To optimize its outreach, CharityML aims to expand its donor base by targeting California residents who are most likely to donate, thereby reducing the overhead cost associated with mass mailing.

## Project Goal:

The objective of this project is to build and optimize a machine learning model that predicts which California residents are most likely to donate to CharityML. By identifying these potential donors, the organization can minimize the number of letters sent, reducing costs while maximizing donation yield.

## Key Steps:

- Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to understand key features influencing donor behavior.
- Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- Model Selection: Evaluate various supervised learning algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting, to identify the best performing model.
- Model Optimization: Fine-tune the chosen model using techniques like grid search and cross-validation to maximize accuracy and minimize the number of letters sent.
- Evaluation: Assess the modelâ€™s performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) to ensure it meets the project's goals.

## Outcome:

The final model will help CharityML efficiently target high-probability donors, leading to a more cost-effective fundraising campaign.

## Technologies Used:

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
